# TrybeSmith Project
I developed this project during my Back-end module studying at Trybe on mid 2022.

---
## Objective
TrybeSmith's primary objective was developing a CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) RESTful API, using TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Docker and MSC(Model, Service, Controller) Architecture.

---
## Some Important Learnings
- Creating and implementing flexible Interfaces.
- Deep error handling.
- Raw database queries on model level.

---
## * Observation
Due to Trybe's evaluation method, this project doesn't have a documented way to run on your computer, but all the code and commits are preserved in this repo.
